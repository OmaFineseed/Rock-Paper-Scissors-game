# Rock-Paper-Scissors-game  
   RPS game is a game built with python for two players and here the game is played by the computer with it's options as cpu_options and the Player whose input is defined as player_options.
  Importing the random module and using it alongside with .choices makes it possible for computer to choose from our list of options.
When the program runs, the players are welcomed and given detailed instructions on how to play the game (you can check the code to see this)
  Next, the player is asked to make a choice from our options. And if the input do no tally with given options, the player is asked to choose again
  When there is a Tie, Win or loose, the player is asked if he/she wishes to continue and if continue is yes, then the program keeps running but if continue is no or any other option, the loop breaks and program ends with GOODBYE
  
  The 'while' loop is used to Keep the program running as long as inputs are true (while True).
